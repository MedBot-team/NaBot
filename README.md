NaBot is a [Rasa-based](https://rasa.com/), smart medical chatbot. It can retrieve medicines and lab tests information for users just by chatting with it.

- Hey, NaBot, can you give me dosage information of Acetaminophen?
- Of course, I can! :wink:

We will support more features in the future. But now, we only support medicines and lab tests information.
